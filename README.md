### Hi there 👋, it's fernandosmither.

## 🚀 About me

#### 👨‍🎓 I'm currently an engineering student at PUC, Chile 🇨🇱 

#### 📖 I really like creating and contributing to Open Source Projects that might be helpful to anyone

#### 🧒 On my early teenage years I started coding for multiplayer videogames servers, like [SA:MP](https://www.sa-mp.com/) (Similar to [MTA:SA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi_Theft_Auto)) and [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft), which got me into coding [Pawno](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawn) (based on C)
#### 🤖 I'm also interested in robotics, as I participated in multiple Robotics competitions during highschool, such as those held by Lego and [Vex Robotics Chile](https://vexrobotics.cl/)
#### 🐍 Nowadays I mostly code on Python, and I'm working on furthering my stack.
